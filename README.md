# EstateTokenChain  

**EstateTokenChain** is a blockchain-based platform built on the **Flexionization method**â€”an innovative approach to regulating asset value through tokenization.
This method increases liquidity, makes real estate investments more accessible, and provides stable income while minimizing risks.  

## ðŸ“Œ What is Flexionization?  
**Flexionization** is a method of balancing asset and token prices, ensuring that tokenized real estate maintains fair valuation. It allows companies to:  
- Efficiently manage assets and reduce volatility.  
- Optimize token pricing in real-time to reflect market conditions.  
- Provide stable income for investors through automated asset management.
